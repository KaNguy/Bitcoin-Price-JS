# Bitcoin Price JS
An incomplete and discontinued API wrapper of [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/), and one of my first JavaScript / Node.JS projects.

## Overview
This was a project I made a long time ago when I was still learning JavaScript and Node.JS  
I discontinued the project and almost forgot about it but I think I should keep it since it was a project I put time into.
